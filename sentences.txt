Better to be poor and healthy rather than rich and sick
Cowards die many times before their deaths
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Every man is the architect of his destiny
Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open
Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones at others
You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink
You show me the man and I'll show you the rule
You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
